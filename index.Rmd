# Overview

We run the pipeline on the Compute Canada servers. Pre-processing steps will be executed with the Sarek pipeline from nf-core [@ewels2020nf].

1. Raw sequence pre-processing and alignment.
2. Germline variant calling for SNVs and indels.
3. Variant annotation and trio analysis to identify disease-causing variants.
